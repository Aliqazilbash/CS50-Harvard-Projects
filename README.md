# CS50-Harvard-Projects

Welcome to my CS50-Harvard-Projects repository! This repository showcases my journey through Harvard University's CS50 course, where I explored various computer science topics and completed several exciting projects.

## Subjects Covered

Throughout the CS50 course, I delved into a wide range of computer science subjects, including:

- **Week 0: Scratch** - Introduction to programming concepts using MIT's Scratch language.

- **Week 1: C Programming** - Fundamentals of C programming, covering data types, control structures, and algorithms.

- **Week 2: Data Structures** - Exploring arrays, memory management, and sorting algorithms.

- **Week 3: Algorithms** - Further study of sorting algorithms and introduction to searching algorithms.

- **Week 4: Memory Management** - Understanding memory allocation, pointers, and dynamic data structures.

- **Week 5: Data Structures Continued** - Implementation and usage of data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues.

- **Week 6: Python** - Transitioning to Python, covering syntax, data types, and object-oriented programming.

- **Week 7: SQL Databases** - Database management and SQL queries.

- **Week 8: Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)** - Introduction to web development, including front-end technologies.

- **Week 9: Web Applications with Flask** - Building web applications using the Flask framework in Python.

- **Week 10: Ethics in Computer Science** - Exploring ethical considerations in technology.

## Notable Projects

Here are some of the exciting projects I completed during the CS50 course:

1. **Space Odyssey (Week 0)** - An interactive space-themed game created using Scratch, where you navigate a spaceship through asteroid fields.

2. **Cryptography Suite (Week 1)** - Developed a command-line program in C to encrypt and decrypt messages using various cryptographic algorithms.

3. **Dynamic Memory Allocator (Week 4)** - Implemented a custom dynamic memory allocator in C, providing memory management features similar to malloc and free functions.

4. **Web Portfolio (Week 8)** - Designed and developed a personal web portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my projects and skills.

5. **Flask Blog (Week 9)** - Created a simple blog website using the Flask web framework, allowing users to write and publish blog posts.

6. **Ethical Tech Report (Week 11)** - Wrote a comprehensive report discussing ethical issues related to emerging technologies like AI and surveillance.
