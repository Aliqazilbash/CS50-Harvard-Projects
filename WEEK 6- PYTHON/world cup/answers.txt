Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
Prediction of Brazil's chances of winning proved wrong as the number of simulations was increased.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
After 100000 simulations I would you call the predictions good enough
